You will be taken to a form to enter your company details. Once you submit the form, the AES for Business registration will start. 

**What happens next?**

- You will receive 2 documents to sign:

 1. **GlobalSign Schedule C**: Customer Digital Signing Service Acknowledgement and Agreement (Article 2.1 is relevant to your company.)

This document must be signed with the advanced (AES) or qualified (QES) electronic signature. If you are not authorised to sign, please send the document to the authorised signatory.

 2. **GlobalSign Terms of Use**
 
 Simple electronic signature (SES) is enough for this document.

- Once both documents are signed, we will send them to our partner GlobalSign.

- GlobalSign will then contact you by e-mail or phone to verify your company details.

If you have a domain, GlobalSign will verify whether you have control over the domain. Please be aware that domain verification may take a few more days.

- Once GlobalSign has successfully verified your company details, we will set up AES for Business for your company. 

- To check that everything is set up correctly, we will send you a test document to sign.

- Once you have successfully signed it, AES for Business will be available to your Skribble Business members.
