  - Commercial register number of your company
  - Name and e-mail address of an internal contact person

You can request AES for Business from your Business profile.

- You'll be taken to a form to provide your company details

- Once you submit the form, the AES for Business registration will start

Next, you will receive 2 documents to sign:
  - **Customer Digital Signing Service Acknowledgement and Agreement**
  - **GlobalSign Terms of Use**
  
If you aren't authorised to sign these documents, please send them to the person who is authorised to sign on behalf of your company.

  - **Customer Digital Signing Service Acknowledgement and Agreement** (This document must be signed with the advanced (AES) or qualified (QES) electronic signature.)

**Note:** We recommend paying attention to Article 2.1 which is relevant to your company.

  - **GlobalSign Terms of Use** (Signing with a simple electronic signature (SES) is enough.)
 
- Once both documents are signed, we'll send them for verification to our partner GlobalSign

- GlobalSign will contact you to verify your company details and whether you have full control of your company domain. This process might take a few more days. 

**You must reply to GlobalSign to prove that you fully control your domain.** If you don't reply, we'll not be able to start setting up AES for Business.

- After GlobalSign has successfully verified your company details, we'll take care of the setup

- To check that everything is set up correctly, we'll send you a test document to sign

- Once you've successfully signed it, AES for Business will be available to your Skribble Business members
