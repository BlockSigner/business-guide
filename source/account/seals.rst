Managing electronic seals
=========================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Enterprise customers. To request an electronic seal for your organisation, contact us at info@skribble.com. 

Electronic seals are applied to documents on behalf of legal and not natural persons and can be used directly on my.skribble.com or via API.

Once Skribble has finished the setup of your seal, you'll be able to:

•	Activate the seal
•	Add and remove API keys and members
•	Add a visual seal (optional)
•	Specify a display name for members

Before your members can use the seal, you’ll have to activate it by adding at least one member or an API key.

**Adding members or API keys**

- From your **Business profile**, go to **Seals**

- Next to the seal you want to activate, click on the **Pencil**

Here you can add members and/or API keys to activate the seal. Activation is a one-time thing. Your users might use the seal directly on my.skribble.com or via the API. 

- Click **Add** next to the **API keys** or **Members**

- If you’re adding **API keys**, select the key from the list and click **Add**

- If you’re adding **Members**, enter an e-mail address of the member and click **Add**

- After this, the seal is activated and can be used by your members.

**Removing members or API keys**

.. NOTE::
   If you remove a member or an API key, they will no longer be able to use the seal.

- Go to **Seals** and click on the **Pencil**

- Navigate to **Members** or **API keys**

- Click on the **X** next to the member or an API key

- Click **Remove** to confirm

**Visual seals (optional)**

You can upload an image to customise the visual appearance of the seal. It will be shown on the sealed documents, just like the visual signature. If you decide to omit it, please inform your Skribble Business members accordingly.

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Upload your seal image and click **Save**

**Display name**

We recommend adding a display name (e.g. department, team) for your seal. It will be shown to your members and helps them select the right seal if they use multiple ones.

To add a display name:

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Enter the **Display name** and click **Save** to confirm
