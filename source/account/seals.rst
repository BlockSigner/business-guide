Managing organisation seals
===========================

.. NOTE::
   This feature is only available to Enterprise customers. To request an electronic seal for your organisation, contact us at info@skribble.com. 

Once we’ve set up the requested seal, you’ll see it in your Skribble Business. Before your members can use the seal, you’ll have to activate it by adding at least one member or an API key. 

**Adding members or API keys**

- Click **Skribble Business** in the lower left

- Go to **Seals**

- Next to the seal you want to activate, click on the **Pencil**

You can now add members and/or API keys to unlock the seal.

- Next to **API keys** or **Members**, click **Add**

- If you’re adding **API keys**, select the key from the list and click **Add** to confirm

- If you’re adding **members**, enter an e-mail address of the member and click **Add** to confirm

- Once done, the seal is ready to be used

**Removing members or API keys**

.. NOTE::
   Once a member or an API key is removed, they no longer will be able to use the seal.

To remove a member or an API key: 

- Go to **Seals**

- Next to the seal you want to activate, click on the **Pencil**

- Navigate to **Members** or **API keys**

- Click on the **X** next to the member or an API key you want to remove

- Click **Remove** to confirm

**Visual seals**

You can upload an image to customise the visual appearance of the seal. It will be shown on the sealed documents, just like the visual signature.

.. NOTE::
   Visual seals are optional and legally not required. If you decide not to add a visual seal, please inform your Skribble Business members accordingly.

To add a visual seal:

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Upload the image and click **Save**

**Display name**

We recommend adding a display name (e.g. department, team) for your seal. It will be shown to your members and helps them select the right seal if they use multiple ones.

To add a display name:

- Go to **Seals**

- Click on the **Pencil** on the right

- Enter the **Display name** and click **Save** to confirm
