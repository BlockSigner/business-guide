Adding Members to your Skribble Business
========================================

There are two ways to add members to your Skribble Business:

- By domain
- By e-mail

The simplest way to add multiple members to your Skribble Business is by registering your company domain (@example.org). Once this is complete, anyone who creates a new Skribble account using your company domain will automatically become a member of your Skribble Business.

.. NOTE::
  Employees who created a Skribble account **before** your domain was registered will not become Skribble Business members automatically. You'll need to add them by e-mail, described in the next section below.
  
  
Adding members by domain
-------------------------

.. NOTE::
  We'll activate the domain immediately once we've checked that it belongs to your company. In some cases, it may take up to 48 hours.
    
- Click **Members** if you aren't already there

- Click **Domains**

- Click **Add domain**

- Enter your domain and click **Add**

You'll find the current status next to the domain added. If the status **Requested** is shown, we'll need to check the domain manually. This may take up to 48 hours.



Adding members by e-mail
-------------------------

The other way to add members to your Skribble Business is by e-mail:

.. NOTE::
   The person must already have a Skribble account before you can add them to your Skribble Business.

- Click **Members** if you aren't already there

- Click **Add Member**

- Enter the e-mail address of the person you want to add to your Skribble Business and click **Add**

You can add multiple e-mails by separating them with a comma.

If the recipient has a Skribble account, they will now be added to your Skribble Business.
